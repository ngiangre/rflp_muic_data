## Neoantigen

A neoantigen is a unique protein on a cancer cell's surface, created by a non-synonymous mutation (a DNA change) in the tumor cell's genome, and is not found on normal cells. Because they are new and specific to the tumor, neoantigens are strong targets for personalized cancer immunotherapies, such as vaccines and adoptive cell therapies, which aim to train the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells.
