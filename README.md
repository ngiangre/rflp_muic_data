## Neoantigen

A neoantigen is a unique protein on a cancer cell’s surface, created by
a non-synonymous mutation (a DNA change) in the tumor cell’s genome, and
is not found on normal cells. Because they are new and specific to the
tumor, neoantigens are strong targets for personalized cancer
immunotherapies, such as vaccines and adoptive cell therapies, which aim
to train the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells.
